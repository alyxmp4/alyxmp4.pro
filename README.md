## Personal website with links and Spotify now playing card

Configure your Spotify API for website using [this](https://leerob.io/blog/spotify-api-nextjs) and enter it into `.env.local` or `.env.production`
as it is shown in `.env.example`. Also you can set up Google Analytics in there too. This website markdown is sort of a remake of [superhooman.co](https://superhooman.co/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
